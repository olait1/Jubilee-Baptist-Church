                               THE DEAD IN CHRIST
                               </h4>
                               <p>
                                    We believe that a brother who sleeps in the Lord is with Christ already 
                                    
                                    – Phil. 1:21-23; I Cor. 5:1-9. Paul said that it is better to come out of this flesh and be with the Lord forever in our Heavenly home. Further still he emphasizes that ” But I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as there which have no hope” I Thess. 4:13-18. Therefore all members should separate themselves form the things of 
                                    this world in worshiping the dead by which we become idolaters – Deut 14:1.

                            ABOUT JESUS CHRIST
                               </h4>
                               <p>
                               We believe that He is the Son of God; Who took away our sins, and the Savior of the
                                world. We also believe that Jesus is God and was born by Mary the Virgin. He is God 
                                revealed in the flesh. Through Him all things were created. John 1:1-14; John 14:9;
                                 Matt. 1:18-25, Is 9:6; Is 53:5-6. We believe in His death on the Cross, and resurrection, 
                                 by which He brought redemption – Is. 53:4-10; I Pet. 2:24; John 10:11;
                                Gal. 3:13, Matt. 20:28; I Cor. 15:3; Rom. 4:25; II Cor. 5:14; Heb 2:9; Heb 9:26.

                            ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT
                               </h4>
                               <p>
                               The Holy Spirit is the third Person in the TRINITY. 
                               He has the same power, the same glory with God the Father and God
                                the Son – John 14:16-17; John 15:26; Matt. 3:16; Acts 13:24.
                                 He is one with Father and the Son who is to be worshiped and served. 
                                 Three Persons that become one are the source of blessings to all the living creatures 
                                 in Heaven and on earth – Matt. 28:19; II Cor. 13:14; I John 1:5-7. The Holy Spirit has 
                                 a great work to perform. He Teaches, He Speaks to men, and bears witness in us 
                                 – Acts 16:6-7; He performs the work of regeneration for man- John 3:5-6; 
                                 He also performs the work of Sanctification in the born again souls until 
                                 they are fully sanctified – John 16:8; Eph 1:17-19; II Thess. 2:13; I Cor. 6:11.
                                  This same Holy Spirit endows believers
                                with gifts they can use – I Cor 12:7; He empowers one in the Lord. Acts 1:8.
